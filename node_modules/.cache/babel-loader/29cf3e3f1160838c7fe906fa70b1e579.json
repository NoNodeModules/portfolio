Their high-quality educational services and career counselling are delivered within a positive team environment. It serves Canadian and international students from over 20 countries, and is committed to assisting their students obtain gainful employment in the shortest possible time. A team consisting of final year students was assigned to assist me with the design of a landing page and website to support a book launch and my personal brand. The team comprised of: Ayaka Tsubouchi Yuya Hashirizaki Anzu Nakayama Gabriel Sciacca Dias Alexandre Bellini Dias Each team member was engaged and fully invested in the project.

But it wouldn't seem like a\n            very mild illness to strangers. Larry thought he would give hope and\n            courage to other patients based on his years of fighting experience.\n            In order to convey this feeling to the website, it is necessary to\n            firmly build the Larry brand to have a strong message to end-users\n            with design, attractive and consistent branding that is not found on\n            general medical sites. And I was convinced that the achievement was\n            the goal of this project.\n          </LarryP>\n          <LarryP style={{ marginTop: \"1.5rem\" }}>\n            This way we could also achieve a more consistent user experience\n            across the different end-users.\n          </LarryP>\n          <LarryP style={{ marginTop: \"1.5rem\" }}>\n            Design methods used during the project included journey mapping,\n            UI/UX design, and prototyping solutions.

Unless design to development all share\n            the same settings or agreed on setting, there is no real \"bridge”\n            between developers and designers.\n          </LarryP>\n          <div style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n            <Image style={{ marginBottom: \"0\" }} src={LarryArticle_5} id=\"\" />\n          </div>\n          <LarryCaption>First design instructions for developers.</LarryCaption>\n          <LarryP>\n            While some developers were inexperienced, it was a difficult to\n            proceed with the project in a limited time to convey the first\n            instruction with the design tool.

But, to\n              have a website designed that captures the wishes and personality\n              of the client is quite different. This presents a unique\n              challenge.
